## Frontend Project
This is the frontend project for the chat application, which communicates with the FastAPI backend to provide a user interface for chat prompts and Gemma API integration.

# Deploying the Backend
Before running the frontend, ensure that the backend server is deployed and running. Follow the instructions in the backend project's README.md file to set up and run the FastAPI server.

# Installation
To set up the frontend project, first clone the repository:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#Running the Frontend
To start the frontend application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the frontend application at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your project configuration).
